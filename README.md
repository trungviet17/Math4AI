# Introduction 
- Hello, I'm Trung from IAI-UET. I had a long Tet holiday so I decided to create this repo to review linear algebra knowledge through the book :Mike Cohen - Practicing Linear Algebra for Data Science data_ From core concepts to applications using Python -O'Reilly Media (2022).
# Structure 
- This repo will divided into three parts: 
    1. Resource : contains documents related to the repo (book, related articles)
    2. Note : record the theory of each chapter in jupyter notebook format 
    3. Coding excercise : solve the excercise at the end of each chapter
